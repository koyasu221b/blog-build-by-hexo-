[MyTAP](https://github.com/theory/mytap) is a good framework for MYSQL integration testing.  
It can help you to test the MYSQL stored procedure and triggers.  
Here're some example test.sql:

```
BEGIN;
SELECT tap.plan(2);
insert into user_info(uid, name) values("0123", "stone");
-- Check the select value
SELECT tap.eq(
     uid,
    "0123",
    'check the uid on user_info table'
) FROM user_info WHERE uid = "0123";

SELECT tap.eq(
     name,
    "stone",
    'check the name on user_info table'
) FROM user_info WHERE uid = "0123";

CALL tap.finish();
ROLLBACK;
```

The following is the excution command.
```
mysql -u root --disable-pager --batch --raw --skip-column-names --unbuffered --database sco --execute 'source test.sql'
```

The tap.plan(2) means here're two unitests, and tap.eq() function can help us to check the value is equal or not.

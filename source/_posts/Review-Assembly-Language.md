When I was young, I remember my fist study programming language is 80x86 assembly language.  
But It's too hard for me to understand the whole concepts of assembly language.  
These days, I was interested in system level of OS kernel. Many system level design was written by assembly language.  
I pick up the book [Assembly Language Step by Step Programming with Linux](http://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Step-Step-Programming/dp/0470497025) to study the assembly again.  
Just like the auther Jeff Duntemann said that **Even if you've learned every single instruction in an instruction set, you haven't learned assembly language**. The most important concept to learn assembly language is the **memory addressing** and **the real mode model and protectd mode model**. 
### What's the advantage to learn assembly language?
Understanding how things work in the low level to help you write more efficient code.
